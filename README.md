# Active Directory Project
## Overview
Hosts my Active Directory project that includes Splunk, Kali Linux &amp; Atomic Red Team.  I explore how a domain environment works, learn how to ingest events to a SIEM, and generate telemetry related to attacks seen in the wild to help you detect them in the future.
